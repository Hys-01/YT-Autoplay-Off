switched to manifest version 2 to avoid script being blocked by chrome/brave 

error message stil shows with 2 but code works 



Maybe in future if wanting to use manifest 3 again, try chrome.tabs.executeScript. Have not tried yet. 



seems to be an issue.

background
  extension was updated, old youtube tab was open. 
  pc reset closed and reopened all tabs
  navigated that youtube tab to a playlist
  extension html worked, css worked, but some error in browser console, functionality didnt work
  upon reloading the youtube tab it works again.

  fuirther testing required

WARNING

seems i must reload page after entering a new playlist. Or reload after changing the toggle once after entering playlist. Further testing required.
