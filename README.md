# Playlist Autoplay Toggle for Youtube™

('Autoplay': the functionality of automatically playing the next video in the queue) 

Youtube playlists lack an option to disable auto-play.

This extension introduces a toggle that can disable/re-enable auto-play for youtube videos in playlists. 

This allows YT playlists to function as libraries/collections of videos.
